### Professional Experience

**Expedia Group** | London, UK
**Machine Learning Scientist III** | *Jan 2025 – Present*

*Transitioned to a full-stack Applied Science role, focusing on ML System Design, Orchestrator APIs, and live/batch deployments while leading research initiatives.*

*   **Aggregated Content Embeddings Semantic Search (ACES) – *New Architecture*:**
    *   Architected the **ACES** engine, the backbone for "Property Expert," a grounded, multi-turn Agentic RAG system designed to function as a "truth layer" for property queries (fees, amenities, policies).
    *   Engineered a high-performance retrieval system integrating unstructured data (reviews, images, `llm.txt`, and fine print) into Vector Databases to enable semantic search with explainability and citations.
    *   Designed for strict latency requirements (p75 < 50ms for end-to-end ranking) to power AI Shopping, Ranking, and Content Generation features.
    *   Built the Python orchestration library and FastAPI interface to allow LLMs to interact directly with the environment using **CodeAct** style agent patterns.
*   **Deep Researcher Agent:** Developing a long-horizon, end-to-end multi-agent travel planner trained with **GRPO**, optimized for complex reasoning, discovery, and itinerary building.
*   **Hallucination Quantification:** Leading research on faithfulness evaluation in GenAI; work accepted at **NAACL 2025**. Developed *TravelBench*, a domain-specific benchmark for travel tasks.

**Expedia Group (Legal & Corporate Affairs)** | London, UK
**Full Stack ML Scientist / Engineer (Internal Rotation)** | *Oct 2025 – Present*

*   **Legacy Document Migration:** Engineering a pipeline using Multimodal LLMs to digitize and process 1M+ legacy hand-scanned PDF documents.
*   **Agentic Legal Workflows:** Building an "IP Research Agent" for patentability assessments and automated contract drafting/Q&A, focusing on high compliance and explainability.

**Expedia Group** | London, UK
**Machine Learning Scientist II** | *Aug 2022 – Jan 2025*

*Traveller Voice & Content Team: Combined applied work and research using Large Language/Multimodal models.*

*   **Review Summarization System (Patented):** Led the development of a large-scale RAG-style summarization system processing over 100 million reviews across millions of properties.
*   **LLM Optimization & Finetuning:**
    *   Finetuned open-source foundation models using efficient methods (LoRA) and SOTA techniques like Reinforcement Learning with verifiable rewards for domain adaptation.
    *   Pioneered efficient large-scale inference practices using **Ray-over-Spark** for multi-node, multi-GPU environments.
    *   Contributed to and adopted frameworks such as **vLLM** and **SGLang** to create cost-effective batch pipelines.

**Expedia Group** | London, UK
**Machine Learning Scientist Intern** | *Summer 2021*
*   Conducted model review on an image ranking model for automatic thumbnail optimization. Discovered model biases and recommended architecture changes that improved performance and efficiency.
